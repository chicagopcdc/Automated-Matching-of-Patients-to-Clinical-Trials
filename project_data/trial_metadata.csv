These patients will be evaluable for Objective 3.1.1 (feasibility of\r\n        vaccine preparation). Patients at first relapse who are eligible for vaccine preparation\r\n        but not administration should instead be treated with standard salvage regimens which may\r\n        include allogeneic bone marrow transplantation according to the judgement of their primary\r\n        oncologist. However, these patients represent a population at extremely high risk for\r\n        progression of their disease following salvage therapy. Many of these patients will\r\n        therefore be likely to fulfill eligibility criteria for vaccination in the future (i.e.', '        should they relapse again, or fail to enter 2nd complete remission). The majority of those\r\n        patients who relapse for a second time will do so within 1 year. Those patients who become\r\n        eligible for vaccination because of 2nd relapse within 1 year of tumor cell collection will\r\n        receive the original vaccine and will not have further vaccine made from tumor cells\r\n        collected at the time of 2nd relapse. Given the proliferative thrust of the disease in many\r\n        patients, it will be advantageous to have vaccines already prepared for these patients to\r\n        reduce the amount of time from 2nd relapse to vaccination.***\r\n      ']"
